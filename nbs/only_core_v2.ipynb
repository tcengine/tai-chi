    "> What library should we be?\n",
    "This proposal, is more of a branding proposal, targeting people who's going to play with AI, from various back grounds.\n",
    "* That means, we're going to talk about how people view this library, how they think of ```pip install -Uqq unpackai``` like if I have dandroff recengtly and my mind just jump right into the headshoulders.\n",
    "* For ML, currently, the **jump** is about the following, this is not a throught marketing research, just quick examples from a deep learning practitioner:\n",
    "    * Try free structure quickly, do experiments: pytorch\n",
    "    * Goes to production, run model on edge devices, Tensorflow\n",
    "    * Play with GPU accelerated tensor calculation: Jax\n",
    "    * Play with tf but in simpler layer sense: Keras\n",
    "    * Transformer in clean code: Huggingface\n",
    "    * Visualize things with interactive features: Plotly\n",
    "    * Deploy model prototype: streamlit\n",
    "* Surely you think I fail to mention ```fastai```, this is where the **branding goes wrong**, fastai library is bounded tightly with the education. It's considered a good creation along side its famous course, after the education. Its product feature has many limitation: docs too brief, not supporting multi-device training, very limited numbers of callbacks went beyond Jeremy H's own teaching.\n",
    "* Most important of all, ```fastai``` isn't enjoyable to use, **it's just packing many things mentioned in the course**."

    "It all started from a notebook, quite like a template notebook we have for the course. A notebook that achieves the data processing, model building, interpretation for a specific DL task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then came the packaging part, we wrap **dozens of lines of codes**, which scares our kind students, into simple functions, or class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wrapped functions are simple to use, to look at, it was executed in 1 line mostly. So friendly to our innocent students.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what a python library is about, right? Wrap things into functions which can be further wraped into even less lines.\n",

    "* A model zoo for a specific domain.\n",
